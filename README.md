# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of project
### Purpose
For this project, we analyzed a data set containing information regarding fundraising campaigns that were run using the crowdfunding platform, _Kickstarter_. We are helping our friend, Louise, who is trying to run her own fundraising campaign in an effort to put on a play, titled _Fever_. Before beginning her campaign, she wanted to analyze data collected on thousands of other fundraising campaigns to see if she could find any insights on which campaigns are successful or not successful, and why some campaigns raise more funding than others. Using these insights, Louise can further increase the chances of her fundraising goals being reached and her play being successful.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this part of our analysis, we looked into how the time of year effected the outcomes of the campaigns. This is very useful information for Louise to know, because if there is any correlation between the time of year the campaigns were launched and the success rate, she can aim to launch her campaign in the time of year when success rates were the highest. This could potentially increase her chances of her campaign being successful. There were four possible outcomes for a campaing in the data we had; these included "canceled," "live," "failed," and "successful." The results of our analysis can be seen in the below chart:

As you can see in this chart, the frequency of "canceled" outcomes remained extremely constant throughout each month. This likely means the time of year did not have much if any effect on the number of canceled campaigns. To a lesser degree, this was also true for the frequency of "failed" outcomes. The number of failed outcomes fluctuated somewhat, and seemed to slightly increase in the summer months and the month of October, but still remained mostly constant throughout the year. The frequency of "successful" outcomes, however, did appear to display a correlation with time of year. There is a very clear spike in successful campaigns that starts in late spring and continues through the summer months. Based off of this information, we recommend that she start her campaign in the late spring or early summer months, perhaps in May or June when the success rates seem to be at their highest. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
