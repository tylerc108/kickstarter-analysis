# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of project
### Purpose
For this project, we analyzed a data set containing information regarding fundraising campaigns that were run using the crowdfunding platform, _Kickstarter_. We are helping our friend, Louise, who is trying to run her own fundraising campaign in an effort to put on a play, titled _Fever_. Before beginning her campaign, she wanted to analyze data collected on thousands of other fundraising campaigns to see if she could find any insights on which campaigns are successful or not successful, and why some campaigns raise more funding than others. Using these insights, Louise can further increase the chances of her fundraising goals being reached and her play being successful.
